# CKB Builder Handbook

Welcome to the CKB Builder Handbook\! This is a resource for all cohort members participating on the ***Community Keeps Building*** Builders’ track.

Here, you’ll find quick links for important resources that will help structure your study, starting from the basics, towards more advanced concepts.

Please note: some documents may refer to Lumos or Capsule for performing tasks. These tools are now deprecated and the best tools are mentioned below.

## Introduction

[**Introduction to Nervos CKB**](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/tech-explanation/nervos-blockchain) \- basic technical concepts and terminology explained

[**Getting started on CKB**](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/getting-started/how-ckb-works) \-   
	  
	[**Quick start**](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/getting-started/quick-start) \- set up your dev environment and project quickly using [OffCKB](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/sdk-and-devtool/offckb). Further information on networks and RPCs are available from this page.

[**CKB Academy lessons 1 and 2**](https://academy.ckb.dev/courses) \- further learning to build your theoretical knowledge

[**Introduction to Script (smart contracts)**](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/script/intro-to-script) \- a introduction to smart contracts on CKB 

As well as working through the above, **it is essential to start your own dev log on GitHub to record your own learning and progress.** Example: [GitHub \- Methemeticz/ckb-builder-track: I log what I learn as part of the Nervos Builder track.](https://github.com/Methemeticz/ckb-builder-track)

For a more detailed dive into the concepts and theory of CKB, a reading list is provided at the end of this document. This should be studied in your own time and is not a requirement prior to starting the beginner exercises.

## Beginner

**Basic exercises** \- once you have set up your environment and understood the technical concepts, get started on these tutorials:

Please note: for all tutorials and practical exercises, please remember to retain screenshots as proof of participation and completion and record on your dev log

	[**Transfer CKB**](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/dapp/transfer-ckb)  
	**[Store Data on Cell](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/dapp/store-data-on-cell)**

The [**L1 developer course**](https://nervos.gitbook.io/developer-training-course/lab-exercise-setup) is another resource to understand the theoretical aspects of CKB. Many Lab exercises here use Lumos or Capsule which you can ignore.

**Learn building on CKB (Javascript, Typescript), using [CCC](https://docs.ckbccc.com/docs/CCC)** (Common Chain Connector), a beginner-friendly all-in-one tool to build applications with integrated support for major wallets:  
	Explore [**CCC App**](https://docs.ckbccc.com/docs/ccc-app)  
	Test your code in the [**CCC Playground**](https://docs.ckbccc.com/docs/playground)  
	[**Code examples**](https://docs.ckbccc.com/docs/code-examples)  
	[**API**](https://api.ckbccc.com/)

For other programming languages:  
	[**Rust SDK**](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/sdk-and-devtool/rust)  
		**[CKB-CLI](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/sdk-and-devtool/ckb-cli)** \- a CKB command-line tool developed in Rust  
	[**Go**](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/sdk-and-devtool/go)  
	**[Java](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/sdk-and-devtool/java)**

Other devtools, including:  
	[**Testnet faucet**](https://faucet.nervos.org/)  
	**[CKB Debugger](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-standalone-debugger)**  
	**[CKB Tools](https://ckb.tools/)** website

### Task: create your own basic application

**Now you can put what you’ve learned above to the test\!**

Use your previous study and the tools above to create a basic application. It could, for example, allow users to generate their own tokens or mint spores (dobs). Discuss your ideas with the programme director (Neon) and with members of CKB DevRel, they will be able to help guide you. If you have some development background already, you may wish to be more adventurous. 

There is always the chance a good idea opens the door to funding from the [Spark programme](https://talk.nervos.org/t/ckb-eco-fund-spark-program-mini-grant-initiative/8752) or the [CKB Community Fund DAO](https://talk.nervos.org/t/ckb-community-fund-dao-willing-to-back-every-ckb-buidler-up)\!

**Simple UDTs (sUDT)**   
A standard that defines the most basic implementation of a UDT (user defined token) fungible token on Nervos. An sUDT on Nervos is the equivalent of Ethereum tokens standards ERC20 or ERC777.

**Nervos DAO**  
Nervos DAO enable users to lock CKBytes to get compensation from Nervos CKB secondary issuance. This process is similar to staking on other platforms. Nervos DAO provides a "virtual hardcap" for CKByte holders to insulate them from inflation.

## Advanced

If you want to challenge yourself further and really grow your skills, study the following resources.

**Script-Sourced Rich Information (SSRI)**  
SSRI is is a protocol for strong binding of relevant information and conventions to the Script itself on CKB. It allows developers to embed arbitrary information/logic into the Script, describing its behavior and managing data to off-chain applications.

[**Introduction**](https://talk.nervos.org/t/en-cn-script-sourced-rich-information-script/8256/2)

	**[Server for calling SSRI methods](https://github.com/ckb-devrel/ssri-server)**  
[**Further Documentation**](https://docs.rs/ckb-ssri-std/0.0.1/ckb_ssri_std/)

	**[Audit report](https://github.com/Alive24/pausable-udt/blob/master/20241224-Pausable-UDT-Final-Audit-Report.pdf)**

**RGB++ \- Bitcoin’s Turing Catalyst**  
RGB++ is an **asset issuance protocol for Bitcoin that leverages the flexibility and programmability of CKB** to enable dynamic use cases for Bitcoin assets. It unlocks the full potential of Bitcoin for a rich application ecosystem without altering its foundational security. This production-ready protocol offers a trustless method for dApps to interact directly with native Bitcoin transactions, facilitated by a lightweight, decentralized verifier.

[**RGB++ Explorer**](https://explorer.rgbpp.io/en)

**xUDT \- Extensible User Defined Token standard**  
xUDT (Extensible User-Defined Token) is a token standard for creating and managing fungible tokens on Nervos CKB. xUDT builds upon the foundational Simple User-Defined Token (sUDT), which uses a minimal, predefined validation model. In contrast, xUDT introduces extensibility by allowing developers to attach custom validation logic via external Scripts — enabling more advanced governance, minting rules, and token behaviors.

**iCKB**  
iCKB is a protocol that aims to solve the illiquidity problem of the NervosDAO by tokenizing NervosDAO deposits into a liquid iCKB token. Website: [www.ickb.org](http://www.ickb.org)
